# WFN Roadmap

## Why this file?
This project existed for more than 10 years, yet it has been dormant for way too long. I ([Khan, or Jérôme Saliba IRL](https://github.com/wokhan)) really want to speed things up to show our users that we didn't forget them.

Mainly because some of you donated (or still do) or supported this project in many different ways, we can't let you down :blush: 

## The roadmap

I identified the following steps:
- [Summer 2020] Migrate WFN to .Net Core 3.1

  Firstly the application will be updated to .Net Core 3.1.
  
  Why? Because it will then allow to improve speed, while updating core functionalities (as the notification trigger). Since notifications are often mentioned as #1 WFN buggy area, it should help a lot.
And, well, I'm a big fan of .Net Core, so it should motivate me (again) :smirk:

- [Aug. 2020] Create (or move) issues / stories

  Many great ideas have been issued through emails, GitHub issues, and so on. It's hard to follow, so a little cleanup and reordering should help see where we are now.

- [Dec. 2020] Fix bugs

  As written above, some bugs should be easier to fix, but there should be nice "surprises" as well when digging into the code (which, as stated, is 10 or 12 years old, at least for some parts).

- [Mar. 2021] Add new features

  Pretty self explanatory.
 
- [No ETA] Update the application design (and apply accessibility rules)

  Design is getting old, I guess a bit of a redesign would help attract new users.
  
Now, why mentioning a long term roadmap (one full year is indeed a long term one)? Only because I know that we all have personal constraints and that while I would like to deal with all this ASAP, I won't be able to.

It's time to be realistic and to fix goals that can actually be reached, even with less free time than ever to work on this project.
